Push better software with Pull Requests presentation
====================================================

A [presentation](https://github.com/robdmoore/PushBetterSoftwareWithPullRequestsPresentation/raw/master/Presentation.pptx) I gave to the [2014 Yow! West conference](http://west.yowconference.com.au/archive-2014/) about pull requests on 13 May 2014.

I have published a practice run of my talk on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6kDwZTazsE).

The talk is based on a [blog post](http://robdmoore.id.au/blog/2013/12/01/using-pull-requests-for-commercialprivateproprietary-development/) that I wrote.

Description
-----------

Developers who are familiar with open source will likely be aware of pull requests, which were created and popularised by GitHub as a way of providing some automation, visibility and social interaction around merging software changes. What is less talked about is the use of pull requests for commercial/private/proprietary software development, which not only yields the same advantages as with open source development, but also a lot more.

In my experiences so far Iâ€™ve found that the single most effective change I have introduced to a software team that has improved the quality of software output is to introduce pull requests. It also has a positive effect on other things like improved collaboration and collective code ownership.

This talk will take a deep-dive into pull requests and explore advantages, gotchas, integrating with a continuous delivery workflow, a range of tips based on my experience so far using them on open source and commercial projects and some tips on how to get started.
